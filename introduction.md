# Introduce yourself and Golang as your experience

I am a dedicated and passionate Golang backend developer 
with 5 years of experience in the field. Over the course of my career,
I have had the privilege of working on a wide range of challenging projects, 
each contributing to my growth and expertise in the Golang ecosystem
Including variety of domain like e-comerce-logistic,a little bit in education and strongly in 
health-care beside I have a short term working on ERP system.

With a deep understanding of backend technologies,
I have honed my skills in crafting efficient, scalable, and reliable solutions.


My journey as a Golang developer began with a curiosity for building high-performance applications and a fascination
for the language's simplicity and elegance. 
Throughout my professional tenure, I have successfully
navigated through various tech stacks,
including PostgreSQL, Redis,  while embracing clean architecture principles to create 
robust and maintainable codebases.



As a Golang backend developer, 
I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what this powerful language can achieve. 
I am eager to contribute my skills and experience
to projects that make a positive impact and look forward to exploring new opportunities to grow.


# Why Golang as your primer programming language?
Golang as my primary programming language because it perfectly aligned with my passion for building high-performance and efficient applications. From the outset, Golang's design philosophy impressed
me with its simplicity, robustness, and focus on concurrency. 

The language's clean and concise syntax, along with its built-in support for concurrent programming, appealed to my desire to create scalable and reliable systems. Moreover, Golang's static
typing and strong compile-time checks ensure code correctness, 
reducing the likelihood of bugs and runtime errors.

One of the main reasons I fell in love with Golang is its exceptional speed and efficiency. The language was purposefully crafted to optimize performance, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring quick execution and responsiveness. Whether it's handling web requests, managing concurrent tasks, 
or processing large datasets, Golang consistently delivers impressive results.


Strong commutity and open source, comprehensive set of tools allows me to focus on solving business problems rather than getting bogged down by boilerplate code.

# Why golang fast?

- Go is a compiled language, which means that the code is translated into machine code before execution. This eliminates the need for an interpreter, resulting in faster execution compared to interpreted languages.
- Go's concurrency model, based on Goroutines and Channels, is designed to be lightweight and efficient. Goroutines are lightweight, concurrent functions that allow for easy concurrency without the heavy overhead of traditional threads. This enables Go to handle thousands of Goroutines efficiently, 
- making it well-suited for concurrent and parallel processing tasks. (light weight 2KB)
    + why goroutine is called a lightweight thread?.<br><br>It’s because a goroutine starts with a stack space of
    2KB which is extremely smaller and more compact than OS thread’s 
    fixed-size stack space of 2MB. However, the goroutine’s stack space is growable and it can grow and exceed the OS thread’s 2MB fixed-stack size. So a goroutine is actually only “lightweight” in the beginning and could gradually grow “overweight” when needed
  
- The Go compiler is optimized to generate efficient machine code, enabling the execution of programs at high speeds. It optimizes code for performance without sacrificing the simplicity and readability of the language.
- Go comes with a garbage collector that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. This reduces the burden on developers to manually manage memory, and the garbage collector is designed to minimize pauses and efficiently release memory, contributing to better performance.
